# **How computational development changed the form of arts**

Developments in media and technology have allowed the art of design to break down its original boundaries: from static to dynamic to interactive, from two-dimensional to three-dimensional to immersive experiences, the aesthetic value of combining technology and design in the future is endless. Visual designers often develop a working model that constantly draws style and elements from culture and art, using computer design software to combine with customized communication content on media vehicles.

## **Art before its engagement with computation**

Before the advent of computer technology, people would record images of social life in that period through poetry, painting and sculpture. For example, Along the River During Qingming Festival (Z, Zeduan), Artists often used simple tools to create their works, incorporating their thoughts into the scenes they saw and eventually passing them on to the world. In the end, the viewer could only understand the artist's ideas through the content of the work, the tone, the brushstrokes, etc. With the advent of computer technology, however, artists have been able to better communicate their ideas to the viewer.

## **Art form in current state**

Art forms and expressions have changed radically since the advent of computation development. Influenced by new science, new technology and new inventions that stimulate the imagination of artists, new media art uses technology to blend the boundaries of disciplines, exploring various media, modes of behavior and other multi-dimensional approaches to art propositions, seeking a variety of possibilities for artistic expression. The advent of computer technology has enriched the possibilities of how artists' work can be realized while giving us, the viewer, the opportunity to appreciate the work of artists from ancient times in a different way. For example, the digital version of Along the River During Qingming Festival in Shanghai Expo, 2010. The original painting was remade into a 3D animated, viewer-interactive digital version, titled River of Wisdom; at 128 × 6.5 m, it is roughly 30 times the size of the original scroll. The computer-animated mural, with moving characters and objects and portraying the scene in 4-minute day and night cycles, was one of the primary exhibitions in the Chinese Pavilion. This way the viewer can undoubtedly appreciate the painting and better understand the author's ideas.

## **Potential future directions of arts**

I believe the change of art form depends on how to better deal with the viewer, how to better express their ideas to the viewer, to evoke more empathy in the audience, to intuitively feel the art in life, to eliminate the barriers to interpretation formed by professionalism and authority, to allow the artist to directly communicate his ideas, and to allow the audience to communicate and dialogue directly with the artist, to share the experience of the artistic process. In addition to this, both ancient and modern art place more emphasis on the visual component, and I believe that in the future, viewers will rely more on their senses of taste, smell, hearing and touch rather than sight.

Beyond the art form, the advent of computation will undoubtedly facilitate our lives and it will foster new habits. Like Meta's VR glasses, you can do anything at home. But these technologies may control our life...
